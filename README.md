⚙️ ESLint Configuration

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react — uses Babel for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — uses SWC for Fast Refresh

If you’re developing a production-grade application, consider using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
Check out the TS template for more info on integrating TypeScript and typescript-eslint.
